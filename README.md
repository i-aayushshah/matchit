# **Fashion Recommendation System**

This project is a fashion recommendation system where users upload photos, and the system automatically compares the hair, skin, and eye color of the uploaded photo with pre-stored reference photos. Based on the closest match, the system suggests products that were used by the person in the reference photo.

## **Requirements**

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed:

1. **Python 3.8+** (for the FastAPI backend)
2. **Node.js** (for the React frontend)
3. **pip** (Python package manager)

---

## **1. Setting Up the Backend (FastAPI)**

The backend uses **FastAPI** to handle file uploads, image processing, and comparison with pre-uploaded reference images.

### **Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**

A virtual environment keeps your project dependencies isolated from your global Python installation.

**For Windows**:
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**For macOS/Linux**:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### **Step 2: Install Backend Dependencies**

After activating the virtual environment, install the necessary packages for the backend.

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn python-multipart Pillow scikit-learn
```

### **Step 3: Run the FastAPI Backend**

Navigate to the `backend/` folder (where the `main.py` file is located) and run the FastAPI server using Uvicorn:

```bash
cd backend
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

The backend should now be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

---

## **2. Setting Up the Frontend (React)**

The frontend is built with **React** and allows users to upload images, which are then sent to the backend for processing.

### **Step 1: Install Frontend Dependencies**

Navigate to the `react-frontend/` folder and install the required dependencies:

```bash
cd react-frontend
npm install
```

This will install all the required packages as listed in the `package.json` file.

### **Step 2: Start the React Frontend**

Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

The React app should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

---

## **3. How to Use the Project**

1. **Access the React Frontend**:
   - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.
   
2. **Upload an Image**:
   - On the main page, use the file upload form to upload an image.
   - Click "Upload" to submit the image.

3. **Receive Suggestions**:
   - After uploading, the backend will process the image and compare it with pre-existing reference images.
   - You will receive product recommendations based on the closest matching reference image.

## **4. Key Commands**

### **Backend Commands**:
- **Install Backend Dependencies**:
  ```bash
  pip install fastapi uvicorn python-multipart Pillow scikit-learn
  ```

- **Run the Backend**:
  ```bash
  uvicorn main:app --reload
  ```

### **Frontend Commands**:
- **Install Frontend Dependencies**:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

- **Run the Frontend**:
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

---

## **5. Additional Tips**

- **Backend**: If you add new Python libraries in the future, make sure to update the backend's `requirements.txt` using:
  ```bash
  pip freeze > requirements.txt
  ```

- **Frontend**: If you encounter any issues with the frontend dependencies, try deleting the `node_modules/` folder and `package-lock.json` file, then run `npm install` again.
